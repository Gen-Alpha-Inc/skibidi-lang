# Skibidi Lang
- My way of using LLVM for fun, this time for a real project (sorry Chris Lattner)
- This is an extremely serious, memory-safe, production-ready language. Meant only for the MOST SERIOUS DEVELOPERS. Everyone else should use Rust, a language notorious for no learning curve (I cannot use Rust).

## Language Spec
- branflakes, but brainrot. You can find a sample explanation at: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Gen_Alpha_Brainrot. I have replaced "ohio" with "yap", since it makes more sense with modern terminology
## Credits:
- The infamous Kaleidascope language by LLVM, a really great resource
- People I know for providing me (someone who has never left their home) with 'slang' that 'trendy' kids use
