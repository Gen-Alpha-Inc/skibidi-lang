# Skibidi Lang
- My way of using LLVM for fun, this time for a real project (sorry Chris Lattner)
- This is an extremely serious, memory-safe, production-ready language. Meant only for the MOST SERIOUS DEVELOPERS. Everyone else should use Rust, a language notorious for no learning curve (I cannot use Rust).

## Language Spec
- Only doubles are allowed, since if you want to be the rizzler, you need to be in a relationship (similar to a double)
- To define a function, use the `skibidefinition` keyword
    - A clear reference to skibidi 
- To use an external function, use the `ext` keyword
    - I couldn't come up with a pun for this, please let me know if there is a good one
    - This allows you to call C++ stl functions, such as sin and cos


### Compiler Info
- For the parser, we use Recursive Descent Parsing and Operator-Precedence Parsing, because Kaleidascope uses it and I am too brainrotted to invest more time to learn something else
## Credits:
- The infamous Kaleidascope language by LLVM, a really great resource
- People I know for providing me (someone who has never left their home) with 'slang' that 'trendy' kids use
